# PROFESSIONAL-STATEMENT

My name is Babatunde Beckley.A highly driven and adaptable professional with a passion for continuous learning and problem-solving. Known for effective communication 
and collaboration skills, with a strong ability to work independently or as part of a team. Balances analytical thinking with creativity to approach challenges strategically, 
aiming to add measurable value and drive efficiency in every project.I would like to start by saying,I have never had any course whatsover on Cybersecurity or any thing 
related to Cybersecurity.But from a Nigerian residing in Brazil and shocked by the rate at which threat actors have increasingly taken over the narrative of my beloved 
country is quite disheartning. Apparently, this is one of the major reasons I joined the course. The desire to change the narrative of not just my country but also mine 
and the hunger to learn is what keeps me going at this point. 

In this digitized world with sophisticated information technology defining our civilization’s landscape, 
we invite even more potent online vulnerabilities. Ransomware attacks, malware, information theft and hacking continue to jeopardize global organizations and individuals. 
Even hacking of servers poses a severe threat to users. Each day, billions of people turn to their systems and handsets to carry out activities that we deem indispensable 
in the age of information. 

Cybersecurity is a necessity in the fast-digitizing world, given that personal information and financial credentials are no longer secure. 
At this point in my life some the stregths I am committed to developing are Adaptability, constantly wanting to evolve in the field of technology and 
Cybersecurity.Being adaptable is crucial. I'm committed to continuously learning, staying updated with the latest trends, and adjusting to new tools or strategies.
Problem-Solving Skills,I’m totally committed to honing my ability to think critically and find solutions to complex problems, whether they involve technical 
challenges, security vulnerabilities, or workflow optimizations and Effective Communication.Whether explaining technical concepts to non-experts or collaborating 
with a team, clear communication is essential. I’m focused on refining this skill to ensure my ideas are understood and that I can engage with diverse audiences 
effectively.I fancy myself walking in the shoes of an accomplished cyber forensic professional in the next five years.I have actually thought about what I would bring 
to the table and I guess being a Nigerian gives me an edge as I can extract information from my sorrounding on how these hackers work and implement this on strategizing 
and stregtening the security of Organisations and Government employees.Unfortunately, I have no experince in this field but believe acquiring one wouldnt be an issue 
as I am determined to help my team in the future.As an individual, I am energetic and enthusiastic. I always look out for a better version of myself, and try to walk 
in his shoes. With relevant industry knowledge and maturity, I would be able to deliver the needful to my organization for a larger goal. I value the privacy of 
information of every being in the world. Technological sophistication may be a boon to us, but that must not rob people of their basic rights. Specializing in cyber 
forensics and security will elevate my profile substantially. It would be a great opportunity to align my passion and professional goals to craft a challenging yet eventful career for myself.
